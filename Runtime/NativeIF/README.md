## UnityNativeEdit
Unity Native Input Plugin for both iOS and Android (Unity UI InputField compatible).
This means you don't need a separate 'Unity' Input box and you can use all native text functions such as `Select`, `Copy` and `Paste`

## Usage
1. Replace all Unity InputFields to NativeInputField script
2. Enable HideMobileInput in NativeInputField (without this the script will fallback to normal unity inputfield)
2. Enjoy!
